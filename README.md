# timer

This timer project is similar to the timer in iPhone. It is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The timer allows users to customize the time, to have options to pause, resume and cancel the timer. The timer displays the end time when the timer counts down to 0 and alarms the user.
